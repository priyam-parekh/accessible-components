                  • The UI is incredibly intuitive, with a magnifying glass icon
                  being shown at the bottom of the application<br /><br />
                  • When pressed, it immediately brings up a search field in the
                  center of the application<br /><br />
                  • When you press anywhere outside of the search field, it
                  exits the search pop up<br /><br />
                  • When the pre-selected search commands are pressed, it
                  automatically completes it<br /><br />
                  • The functionality of the search box are definitely learnable
                  as it uses realistic iconography through the magnifying
                  glass—a recognizable icon for search<br /><br />
                  • Out of all 3 applications, this is the most simple and
                  compact while still being accessible for users
                </td>
                <td>
                  • To get to the search bar, the user has to open the left
                  sidebar and click on the magnifying glass icon that says
                  "Search"<br /><br />
                  • This can be hard to find, especially because it's concealed
                  within the sidebar<br /><br />
                  • When clicked, it opens the search box in the middle of the
                  screen and darkens the background<br /><br />
                  • As you type, it creates suggestions based on the text<br /><br />
                  • While the functionality of the search box is intuitive, the
                  number of suggestions can be overwhelming for the user<br /><br />
                  • However, it is useful that there are a plethora of recent
                  pages that appear in the search field—essentially predicting
                  your prompts<br /><br />
                  • This UI is definitely more cluttered when compared to Things
                  or Gmail; however, it is more feature-rich
                </td>
                <td>
                  • The search box is prominently placed at the top of the
                  screen<br /><br />
                  • After clicking on the search box, it provides basic
                  suggestions and previously searched queries<br /><br />
                  • The UI is intuitive and simple<br /><br />
                  • It is designed to be used by the average consumer<br /><br />
                  • It is fairly memorable as the Gmail design has been
                  relatively the same for the past few years<br /><br />
                  • In terms of accessibility, I would say it is ranked the
                  highest out of all 3 platforms
                </td>

                <th>Keyboard</th>
                <td>
                  • To initiate the search box, the user can press Cmd + F which
                  leads to the same search box component as using the magnifying
                  glass<br /><br />
                  • After typing a specific keyword or pre-selected search
                  commands, the user can use the arrow keys to either move their
                  selection up or down<br /><br />
                  • This command and interaction is intuitive and follows
                  conventional navigation<br /><br />
                  • It possesses all functionality that a search box should
                  have—especially with added smart suggestions as you type<br /><br />
                  • Again, I would say that this UX ranks highly in terms of
                  accessibility and intuitive input
                </td>
                <td>
                  • To start the search box, the user can press Cmd + K, which
                  results in the search command to be executed<br /><br />
                  • The user can then use the arrow keys to move up or down in
                  the search results and use tab to switch to the filters<br /><br />
                  • Once the command is learned by a user, it is much easier to
                  access and use
                </td>
                <td>
                  • There is no real way to use a command to open the search bar
                  in Gmail<br /><br />
                  • However, the user can use the tab key to switch through each
                  UI element on the screen<br /><br />
                  • While inefficient, it does work as intended<br /><br />
                  • This is fairly learnable and does follow basic accessibility
                  standards
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Mobile/<br />Touchscreen</th>
                <td>
                  • On the Things mobile app, there are 2 ways to access the
                  search box<br /><br />
                  • First, is to go to the main menu page and click on the top
                  search bar<br /><br />
                  • The other meethod is to swipe down from anywhere in the
                  app<br /><br />
                  • The former method is definitely more intuitive; however, the
                  latter is meant for power users who care about efficiency and
                  ease of access<br /><br />
                  • However, after learning the swipe to search feature, it is
                  both memorable and efficient<br /><br />
                  • To cancel out of the search field, there is a cancel button
                  on the top right and the user can also click anywhere outside
                  of the app
                </td>
                <td>
                  • On the Notion app, there is a magnifying glass icon in the
                  bottom bar which is accessible in all parts of app<br /><br />
                  • The UI of the actual search box is nearly identical to the
                  desktop app<br /><br />
                  • It provides suggestions as you type and contains a cancel
                  button to exit out of the search field in the top right<br /><br />
                  • The functionality is extremely simple and is shared across a
                  majority of mobile apps (having the search icon on the bottom
                  bar)
                </td>
                <td>
                  • Similar to the browser version on desktop, the mobile app
                  also places the search bar prominently on the

              • In terms of usability and accessibility, all 3 platforms
              (Things, Notion, and Gmail) faired well as they were easy to
              navigate, and use, and displayed the functionality to the user.
              For instance, Things was incredibly intuitive when it came adding
              and viewing the different task lists; however, it was not the best
              for accessibility since some parts of the application were
              difficult to navigate to using focus order and screen reader. In
              my design, I used Thing's user interface and Gmail's accessibility
              into account to meet both aspects of design.
            </p>

            <p class="context-text">
              • The accessibility considerations that were not not addressed in
              the components was discoverability. It is important that the user
              can discover the functionality of the interface—resulting in me
              including automatic suggestions and an info section in my design.
            </p>

            <p class="context-text">
              • Based on the video, "mismatch" refers to the gap between a
              person's abilities and the design of a particular product; I
              effectively bridge this gap by allowing non-tech savvy individuals
              use the search box with automatic suggestions and improving
              discoverability.
            </p>

            <p class="context-text">
              • An example of how the inaccessibilitity of Notion's search box
              (input) when using a mouse/trackpad could negatively impact users
              with impairments is that it is placed in the side bar, essentially
              concealed—this could make it harder for a screen reader to detect
              it. Another example which relates to output is with the
              inaccessibility of Gmail's drag and drop function which doesn't
              show the user where a email could be dropped to.
            </p>

            <p class="context-text">
              • Mouse and keyboard would most commonly be prioritized when
              creating user interface components because most websites are
              accessed on a laptop/desktop. This impacts the user experience by
              having icons and text more smaller on the screen because a mouse
              is more precise; this results in a site on a mobile device being
              smaller and harder to press and navigate.
